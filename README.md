# 🎂 Birthday Surprise Web App 🎉

> An over-engineered birthday surprise built with 3D graphics and hand tracking AI.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is a 3D interactive birthday web application featuring:

- 🎬 Dramatic terminal-style intro
- 🎨 3D birthday cake scene
- 🕯️ Interactive candles
- 🤖 Hand tracking to blow candles (via camera)
- 🎉 Confetti celebration effects
- 💌 Custom birthday card popup

Instead of giving a regular birthday card…  
I built a full web application. Naturally.
